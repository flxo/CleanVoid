CleanVoid theme for the Cinnamon desktop
========================================

This theme is derived from [Void](http://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes/view/104). All that asymetric edges are removed and the panel is not divided. IMHO this plays well with Mint-X-Grey the screenshots below show.

Installation
